# hello-world
This repository is for practising the GitHub flow.
I am a beginner of deeplearning, having some coding experience in Matlab before, but no python experience. I am currently working with some time series analysis and fault detection projects, managing to apply deeplearning models. I need to adapt the proper models to my projects and do the coding work as well.
